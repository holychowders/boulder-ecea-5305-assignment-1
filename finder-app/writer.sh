# Step 10: Write a shell script finder-app/writer.sh as described below
#
#     Accepts the following arguments:
#       - the first argument is a full path to a file (including filename) on the filesystem, referred to below as writefile;
#       - the second argument is a text string which will be written within this file, referred to below as writestr
#
#     Creates a new file with name and path writefile with content writestr, overwriting any existing file and creating the path if it doesn’t exist.
#
#     Exits with value 1 error and print statements if any of the arguments above were not specified
#     Exits with value 1 and error print statement if the file could not be created.
#
#     Example: writer.sh /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt ios creates file /tmp/aesd/assignment1/sample.txt with content: ios
#

#!/bin/sh
